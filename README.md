### Hi!

  Hi! My name is Guilherme, and I am a passionate Data Engineer. When not building data pipelines and managing cloud infrastructure, I dive into the world of Rust. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, particularly in Python. If you have an exciting project or need assistance, please contact me at guimarret@gmail.com. I'm always eager to learn, grow, and collaborate on new opportunities.

Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch!
