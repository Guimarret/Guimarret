###Hi!
  My name is Guilherme and I am a Data Engineer at EVT. In my free time, I study Julia and Rust and enjoy contributing to open source projects, particularly in Linux and Python. If you have a project that could use my assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at guimarret@gmail.com. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
